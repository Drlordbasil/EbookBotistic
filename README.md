## Installation

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries and dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install imgaug ebooklib
   ```

2. Download and save the input_image.jpg file in the same directory as the Python program.

3. Execute the Python program by running the following command:
   ```
   python program.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the program and generate ebooks and photos, follow these steps:

1. Define the ebook and photo models in the EbookModel and PhotoModel classes, respectively. Each model should have a unique title or augmentation name.

2. Create instances of the EbookModel and PhotoModel classes to define the models you want to use for ebook and photo generation.

3. Create an instance of the EbookPhotoGenerator class, passing the ebook models and photo models as arguments.

4. Use the generate_ebook_and_photo method of the EbookPhotoGenerator instance to generate an ebook and a photo. Provide the ebook title and content as arguments.

Example:
   ```
   ebook_models = [
       EpubModel('Chapter 1', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet'),
       EpubModel('Chapter 2', 'Consectetur adipiscing elit'),
       EpubModel('Chapter 3', 'Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua')
   ]

   photo_models = [
       PhotoModel('rotate'),
       PhotoModel('flip'),
       PhotoModel('contrast')
   ]

   generator = EbookPhotoGenerator(ebook_models, photo_models)
   generated_ebook, generated_photo = generator.generate_ebook_and_photo('My Ebook', 'This is the content of my ebook')
   ```

5. The generated ebook and photo filenames will be returned. Save and use them as needed.

Example:
   ```
   print(f"Ebook generated: {generated_ebook}")
   print(f"Photo generated: {generated_photo}")
   ```
